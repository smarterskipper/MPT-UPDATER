### ---BUILT FOR AKI VERSION 3.8.1---

### NEW: Enhanced color configuration when the Color Converter plugin is also enabled!
To use hexcodes and change color profiles (for colorblindness and personal preference), check out the new config options!

### NEW: Full SPT Realism mod support!
Notice: If you're not using Realism's Ballistic changes, disable the Realism support in the config.jsonc file to have the correct armor penetration tier stats and colors.

This mod adds the stats of different types of ammo, including modded ammo, in their descriptions. See configuration in src/config.json for configuration.

Currently, you are able to change the mode between "prepend" and "append" modes. 
Prepend mode will print the damage, penetration, and effective armor levels before the ammo description (it comes first.)
Append mode will add them to the end of the description. You may have to scroll down a bit depending on the length of the game's description.

You can also change the separator from "newline" to "oneline", which changes the values from being split on new lines to all being fit on one line, separated by pipes ( | ).

Three values are added, Damage (the raw damage), penetration (raw penetration value), and highest armor tier it is effective against (directly calculated from the penetration value).
Shotgun buckshot is shown per pellet, with how many pellets are fired, and total possible damage in parenthesis afterwards.
Effective armor levels are calculated similarly to NoFoodAfterMidnight's Ammo and Armor sheet, the highest tier it is moderately effective against is shown.

All languages should be supported, but the text will still be in english unless it is localized - easily done by copying the entire block for "en" and changing the key from en to your locale name.
See the entry for "kr"/"ru" for a clear example.

If you create a language addition, please PM me on Discord (@RaiRaiTheRaichu#) â€‹or on hub.sp-tarkov.com (much slower response time) with the information and the mod will be updated and you can be credited.


## ---INSTALL INFO---

How to install:
Drag and drop the included `user` folder from this zip into your SPT-Aki folder, allow it to merge with your existing folder.

If you're updating from an older version, please be sure to delete the old mod from your folder. You may want to back up your color profile settings if you've customized them as well.

If you want to enable more color options, please install the Bepinex Color Converter API plugin as well to your BepInEx/plugins/ folder!
If you're running the server from a separate folder, please make sure the plugin is also located within a BepInEx/plugins/ folder in the same directory - this mod checks for the plugin by the presence of the .dll in order to enable the extended functionality.


## ---CHANGELOGS---

#### v1.0.0 Changelog: 
- Ammo values (damage, penetration) that has been changed via a mod will be shown with their modded values properly, and ammo that was created by a mod is also now supported.
